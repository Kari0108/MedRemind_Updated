## 🗄️ Database

The application uses SQLite for data storage. The database file (`medicines.db`) is automatically created in the `backend` directory when you first run the server.

**Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE medicines (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    dosage TEXT,
    time TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);
```

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effect with blur and transparency
- **Dark Theme**: Modern dark background with gradient accents
- **Smooth Animations**: Slide-up cards, fade transitions, and hover effects
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Spinners and loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and toasts

## 🔒 Security Notes

- API keys are stored in the backend `.env` file (never exposed to frontend)
- CORS is enabled for development
- Input validation is performed on the backend
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Ensure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Ensure dependencies are installed: `cd backend && npm install`
- Check if port 3000 is already in use

### AI explanation not working
- Verify your Gemini API key is correct in `.env`
- Check your internet connection
- The API key must be valid and active

### Sound not playing
- Click "🔔 Sound On" to enable sound
- Browsers require user interaction before playing audio
- Check your system volume settings

### Database errors
- The SQLite database is automatically created
- Delete `backend/medicines.db` to reset the database
- Ensure write permissions for the backend directory
